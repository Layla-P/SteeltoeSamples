## Basic App Flow:
In this example, we have setup a microservices architecture to understand the flow more easily and there are also some keypoints that I have noticed which I will share.

There are two microservices

1. Product.API
2. Notification.API


When a request comes to `Product.API` to add a product, a notification will be generated by `Notification.API`. `Notification.API `will not be called directly hence we have used `RabbitMQ` to follow a event driven architecture.

## GuidLines:

1. In `Program.cs`, if you have used below method then configuration for RabbitMQ from `appSettings.{env}.json` will be picked: 

    `builder.Services.ConfigureRabbitOptions(config);`

    - If you dont use that method then there is no need to specify any configuration in `appSettings.{env}.json` until you have RabbitMQ running on
    default url with default credentials.
    - If you call that method but did not specify anything in appsettings.env.json then it will not throw any error and will pick default
credentials automatically 

    **URL:**```http://localhost:15672/``` 

    **UserName:**```guest```

    **Password:**```guest```


2. ##### JSON serialization
   With `true` param JSON serialization will be used:
   `builder.Services.AddRabbitServices(true);`
